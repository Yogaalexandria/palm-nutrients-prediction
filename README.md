Calcium (Ca) and Boron (B) are macro and micro nutrients for sustaining the optimum productivity of oil palm. However, current techniques for assessing the nutritional status of oil palm rely on destructive methods that have weakness, particularly with regard to timeliness, spatial variance representation, and high cost of laboratory testing. Consequently, one solution to swiftly, precisely, and affordably ascertain the Ca and B status in oil palm trees are through the utilization of Sentinel-2 images and intelligent system algorithms. Sentinel-2A level 2 images and palm leaf sample (LSU) are the data sources used in this research. The Sentinel- 2A image processing technique consists of resampling the image to bring the resolution of each band to 10 x 10 meters, masking the image with plantation boundaries, and utilizing a point sampling tool to extract the image values. The developed machine learning-based model employes the vegetation index and multispectral bands as independent variables, while Calcium and Boron data from laboratory tests are used as dependent variables. The sample data is divided into two groups, namely training and test data, with a composition of 90% and 10%. The research results demonstrate that the intelligent model based on the SVR algorithm has superior prediction performance than the ANN-based model, as evidenced by the SVR-based model's accuracy value on test data of 84.28% for Calcium and 86.47% for Boron. The SVR-based model's accuracy value for Calcium training data is 84.14%, while for Boron training data it is 85.69%.
